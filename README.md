#^Grabr

###*Grabr is a bookmarklet used for displaying all images on a webpage.*

  
####Features:
+    Lists all images on the page from img tags and local css sheets.
+    Polls for EXIF data (if there is any available), if the image uses alpha, how many bits per pixel and how large the file is.
+    Change the background behind the images with a click.

####Tips:
+    If the image is not stored locally then any EXIF data will not be able to extracted (stated undefined). However if you click on the source url you will be able to come to the hosted page where you can click on grabr again to get the EXIF data.
+    If the sytlesheets are not on the same domain then by clicking on the stylesheets in the notices it will be then able to open those images by simply clicking on the ^Grabr bookmarklet again.
